# impact_of_activity_mitigation

Health systems commonly attempt to mitigate potentially unnecessary hospital activity by efforts to prevent, redirect/substitute or de-adopt low value hospital activity but little is known about its impact. 

Aim: We examine the macro level impact of mitigation in the English National Health Service (NHS) by comparing growth rates for hospital activity that is in the purview of mitigation versus activity which is not.
